entities:

    # in this alternative approach, we have several "disease" entity types, 
    # each of which has exactly one entity of the same name: 
    covid-19:
        - covid-19
    hiv/aids:
        - hiv/aids

    # regular entity types:
    agent: 
        n: 1000
        named:
            - patient zero  # the first infected one
            - immune patient  # some immune patient


relationship types:

    # the epidemiological state of an agent w.r.t. a disease 
    # is now encoded in the relationship type.
    # to each disease, an agent has exactly one link of one of the following types:
    is susceptible to: ~
    is infectious for: has infected  # here we need an inverse to be able to specify the social dynamics 
    has recovered from: ~
    has died of: ~

    # other relationships:
    is acqu. with: symmetric  # permanent social tie
    regularly meets: symmetric  # variable due to social distancing

initial links: 

    named:
        - [patient zero, is infectious for, covid-19]
        - [immune patient, has recovered from, covid-19]

    random:
        # initially, all agents must be in some state regarding each disease!
        [agent, is susceptible to, covid-19]:
            probability: 1
        [agent, is susceptible to, hiv/aids]:

        # initially, agents' ties form a random geometric graph:
        [agent, is acqu. with, agent]:
            dimension: 2  # planar embedding
            decay: 20.0  # characteristic range of influence is 1/20 of the diameter of the territory
        # we do not specify that they also meet regularly 
        # since these links will form immediately due to our specification below

dynamics:

    # EPIDEMIC MODEL:
    #
    # this time, the transition between states is modeled as follows:
    # when i has a link of type A to some disease X and A may lead to B, i it may get a link of type B to X.
    # to specify this influence, we use the angle "i --A--> X = X", i.e., we make use of the identity relationship X = X.
    # when i has links of both types A and B to some disease X, 
    # and the transition can only go from A to B but not from B to A,
    # we can specify that the type-A link breaks immediately and can thus use once the transition rate as the est. attempt rate.*
    # if the transition can go both ways, we must specify that both links break immediately (as before),
    # and hence must specify twice the transition rates as the est. attempt rates.
    # (* we could have the same already in the other SIR-model version)
