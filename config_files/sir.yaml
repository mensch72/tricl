entities:

    # first list entity types and entities representing possible epidemiological states an agent can be in.
    # each agent will be linked to exactly one of these entities, or to none of them if in state "susceptible". 
    infectious:
        - infectious  # this entity represents the state of being infectious and has its own entity type
    recovered:
        - recovered  # this entity represents the state of being recovered and has its own entity type

    # then list the other (regular) entity types:
    agent: 
        n: 1000
        named:
            - patient zero  # the first infected one


relationship types:

    regularly meets: symmetric  # the social tie that enables mutual infection
    is: ~  # used in "<agent> is <state entity>"
    may lead to: ~  # used in "<state> may lead to <state>"
    is incompatible with: symmetric  # used in "<state> is incompatible with <state>"

initial links: 

    named:
        # here we list the possible transitions between states:
        - [infectious, may lead to, recovered]
        - [infectious, is incompatible with, recovered]

        # and here some initial states (if any):
        - [patient zero, is, infectious]

    random:
        [agent, regularly meets, agent]:
            dimension: 2  # planar embedding
            decay: 20.0  # characteristic range of influence is 1/10 of the diameter of the territory


dynamics:

    # the transition between states is modeled as follows:
    # when i is linked to some state A and A may lead to B, i it may get linked to B.
    # when i is linked to both A and B, one of the two links will break immediately because they are mutually incompatible.
    # since the latter occurs for both links with probability 1/2, the resulting transition rate equals half the attempt rate.
    # hence one must specify twice the desired transition rate as the attempt rate. 

    [agent, is, infectious]:
        establish:  # infection
            attempt:
#                basic: 0.001  # rare initial infection from outside the network
                [agent, regularly meets, agent, is, infectious]: 0.1  # transmission rate of infection by transmission (VARY!)
            success: .inf  # if only one number is specified, it is the "basic" success probunits
        terminate:  # this link will only be terminated when a link to "recovered" exists:
            attempt:
                [agent, is, recovered, is incompatible with, infectious]: .inf  # -> one of the two links breaks immediately, each with probability 1/2 
            success: .inf

    [agent, is, recovered]:
        establish:  # recovery
            attempt:
                [agent, is, infectious, may lead to, recovered]: 1.0  # = recovery rate 0.5 times two 
                    # this is twice (!) the rate of transition from infectious to recovered (VARY!) 
                    # twice because with probability 1/2 the established link will break away again immediately
                    # and with the other 1/2 probability the previous link to "infectious" will break away instead. 
            success: .inf
        terminate:  # this link will only be terminated when a link to "infectious" exists:
            attempt:
                [agent, is, infectious, is incompatible with, recovered]: .inf  # -> one of the two links breaks immediately, each with probability 1/2
