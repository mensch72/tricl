  description: 
    300 entities of one type,
    in 3 disjoint blocks fully connected by a unique symmetric relationship type,
    slow spontaneous linking,
    medium-speed linking due to angles (triangle closure),
    and fast spontaneous unlinking hampered by angles (triangle staibilization),
    leading to metastable clusters which eventually merge.
